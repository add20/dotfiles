# ==> ruby-build
# ruby-build installs a non-Homebrew OpenSSL for each Ruby version installed and these are never upgraded.
# 
# To link Rubies to Homebrew's OpenSSL 1.1 (which is upgraded) add the following
# to your ~/.zshrc:
export RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)"

# Note: this may interfere with building old versions of Ruby (e.g <2.4) that use
# OpenSSL <1.1.
